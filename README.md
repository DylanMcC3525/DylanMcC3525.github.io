# DylanMcC3525.github.io
 
DylanMcC3525.github.io is a website that showcases my portfolio, I built this site using HTML, CSS and a little bit of JS. This site is to showcase my skill for employers and not just tell them about it. I originally had a different design but when making the site it was easier interpreted with the colors I have now.
